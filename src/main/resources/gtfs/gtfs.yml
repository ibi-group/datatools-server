  name: feed_info.txt
  helpContent: The file contains information about the feed itself, rather than the services that the feed describes. GTFS currently has an agency.txt file to provide information about the agencies that operate the services described by the feed. However, the publisher of the feed is sometimes a different entity than any of the agencies (in the case of regional aggregators). In addition, there are some fields that are really feed-wide settings, rather than agency-wide.
  fields:
  - name: "feed_publisher_name"
    required: true
    inputType: TEXT
    columnWidth: 12
    helpContent: "The feed_publisher_name field contains the full name of the organization that publishes the feed. (This may be the same as one of the agency_name values in agency.txt.) GTFS-consuming applications can display this name when giving attribution for a particular feed's data."
  - name: "feed_publisher_url"
    required: true
    inputType: URL
    columnWidth: 12
    helpContent: "The feed_publisher_url field contains the URL of the feed publishing organization's website. (This may be the same as one of the agency_url values in agency.txt.) The value must be a fully qualified URL that includes http:// or https://, and any special characters in the URL must be correctly escaped. See http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html for a description of how to create fully qualified URL values."

Feed providers are encouraged to give schedule data outside this period to advise of likely future service, but feed consumers should treat it mindful of its non-authoritative status. If feed_start_date or feed_end_date extend beyond the active calendar dates defined in calendar.txt and calendar_dates.txt, the feed is making an explicit assertion that there is no service for dates within the feed_start_date or feed_end_date range but not included in the active calendar dates."
