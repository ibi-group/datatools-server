/**
 * This job handles merging two or more feed versions according to logic specific to the specified merge type.
 * The current merge types handled here are:
 * - {@link MergeFeedsType#REGIONAL}: this is essentially a "dumb" merge. For each feed version, each primary key is
 * scoped so that there is no possibility that it will conflict with other IDs
 * found in any other feed version. Note: There is absolutely no attempt to merge
 * entities based on either expected shared IDs or entity location (e.g., stop
 * coordinates).
 * - {@link MergeFeedsType#MTC}:      this strategy is defined in detail at https://github.com/conveyal/datatools-server/issues/185,
 * but in essence, this strategy attempts to merge a current and future feed into
 * a combined file. For certain entities (specifically stops and routes) it uses
 * alternate fields as primary keys (stop_code and route_short_name) if they are
 * available. There is some complexity related to this in {@link #constructMergedTable(Table, List, ZipOutputStream)}.
 * Another defining characteristic is to prefer entities defined in the "future"
 * file if there are matching entities in the current file.
 * Future merge strategies could be added here. For example, some potential customers have mentioned a desire to
 * prefer entities from the "current" version, so that entities edited in Data Tools would override the values found
 * in the "future" file, which may have limited data attributes due to being exported from scheduling software with
 * limited GTFS support.
 *
 * Reproduced from https://github.com/conveyal/datatools-server/issues/185 on 2019/04/23:
 *
 * 1. When a new GTFS+ feed is loaded in TDM, check as part of the loading and validation process if
 *    the dataset is for a future date. (If all services start in the future, consider the dataset
 *    to be for the future).
 * 2. If it is a future dataset, automatically notify the user that the feed needs to be merged with
 *    most recent active version or a selected one in order to further process the feed.
 * 3. Use the chosen version to merge the future feed. The merging process needs to be efficient so
 *    that the user doesn’t need to wait more than a tolerable time.
 * 4. The merge process shall compare the current and future datasets, validate the following rules
 *    and generate the Merge Validation Report:
 *    i. Merging will be based on route_short_name in the current and future datasets. All matching
 *      route_short_names between the datasets shall be considered same route. Any route_short_name
 *      in active data not present in the future will be appended to the future routes file.
 *    ii. Future feed_info.txt file should get priority over active feed file when difference is
 *      identified.
 *    iii. When difference is found in agency.txt file between active and future feeds, the future
 *      agency.txt file data should be used. Possible issue with missing agency_id referenced by routes
 *    iv. When stop_code is included, stop merging will be based on that. If stop_code is not
 *      included, it will be based on stop_id. All stops in future data will be carried forward and
 *      any stops found in active data that are not in the future data shall be appended. If one
 *      of the feed is missing stop_code, merge fails with a notification to the user with
 *      suggestion that the feed with missing stop_code must be fixed with stop_code.
 *    v. If any service_id in the active feed matches with the future feed, it should be modified
 *      and all associated trip records must also be changed with the modified service_id.
 *      If a service_id from the active calendar has both the start_date and end_date in the
 *      future, the service shall not be appended to the merged file. Records in trips,
 *      calendar_dates, and calendar_attributes referencing this service_id shall also be
 *      removed/ignored. Stop_time records for the ignored trips shall also be removed.
 *      If a service_id from the active calendar has only the end_date in the future, the end_date
 *      shall be set to one day prior to the earliest start_date in future dataset before appending
 *      the calendar record to the merged file.
 *      trip_ids between active and future datasets must not match. If any trip_id is found to be
 *      matching, the merge should fail with appropriate notification to user with the cause of the
 *      failure. Notification should include all matched trip_ids.
 *    vi. New shape_ids in the future datasets should be appended in the merged feed.
 *    vii. Merging fare_attributes will be based on fare_id in the current and future datasets. All
 *      matching fare_ids between the datasets shall be considered same fare. Any fare_id in active
 *      data not present in the future will be appended to the future fare_attributes file.
 *    viii. All fare rules from the future dataset will be included. Any identical fare rules from
 *      the current dataset will be discarded. Any fare rules unique to the current dataset will be
 *      appended to the future file.
 *    ix. All transfers.txt entries with unique stop pairs (from - to) from both the future and
 *      current datasets will be included in the merged file. Entries with duplicate stop pairs from
 *      the current dataset will be discarded.
 *    x. All GTFS+ files should be merged based on how the associated base GTFS file is merged. For
 *      example, directions for routes that are not in the future routes.txt file should be appended
 *      to the future directions.txt file in the merged feed.
